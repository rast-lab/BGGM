====

This package includes methods introduced in Williams, Rast, Pericchi, and Mulder (2019), Williams and Mulder (2019), and Williams (2018). The package is built around two Bayesian approaches for inference: estimation and hypothesis testing.

The estimation based methods are described in Williams (2018). They offer advantages compared to classical methods, in that a measure of uncertainty is provided for all parameters. For example, each node has a distribution for variance explained (i.e., Bayesian *R*<sup>2</sup>). Measures of out-of-sample prediction error are available, which also have a measure of uncertainty. The model is selected with credible interval exclusion of zero or a region of practical equivalence. This allows for computing the posterior probability for an assumed *null* region--i.e., conditional independence. It is also possible to compare partial correlations.

The hypothesis testing based methods are described in Williams and Mulder (2019), and allow for testing edges (i.e., partial correlations) with the Bayes factor. One-sided hypothesis testing is also possible. These methods provide (relative) evidence for the null hypothesis. There are extensions for **confirmatory hypothesis testing** in GGMs--e.g., inequality or equality constraints on the partial correlations. This allows for comparing theroetically informed models with Bayseian model selection.

Further, it is possible to assess differences as well as similarities (i.e., the null hypothesis) between GGMs. These method were introduced in Williams, Rast, Pericchi, and Mulder (2019). Graphs are compared either with the posterior predictive distribution or Bayesian model selection. The latter allows for testing hypothesized changes in graphical structures between, for example, control and treatment groups. The posterior preditive approach is based on KL-divergence. It allows for testing the assumed (null) model of group equality for the entire graph or specific variables. These methods can be used to comapre any number of GGMs.

Estimation
==========

Structure Learning
------------------

By structure learning we are referring to selecting the graph (i.e., the edge set *E*), which consists of those edges determined to be non-zero. For demonstrative purposes, we consider a relatively small number of variables (*p* = 5).

The package **BGGM** offers a convenient analytic solution for estimating GGMs. It is implemented with:

``` r
library(BGGM)

library(ggplot2)
library(ggraph)
library(foreach)

# p = 5
Y <- BGGM::bfi[,1:5]

# analytic solution
fit_analytic <- estimate(Y, analytic = T)

# summary
summary(fit_analytic)
#> BGGM: Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Models 
#> --- 
#> Type: Estimation (Analytic Solution) 
#> Posterior Samples: 
#> Observations (n): 2709 
#> Variables (p): 5 
#> Edges: 10 
#> --- 
#> Call: 
#> estimate.default(x = Y, analytic = T)
#> --- 
#> Date: Sun May 12 08:02:29 2019
```

Note `summary(.)` provides information about the fitted model, including that the analytic solution was used, the number of observations (*n*) and variables (*p*), and the number of edges.

The edge set is then selected with:

``` r
# select the graph (edge set E)
E <- select(fit_analytic, ci_width = 0.95)

# summary of E
summary(E)
#> BGGM: Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Models 
#> --- 
#> Type: Selected Graph (Analytic Solution) 
#> Credible Interval: 95 % 
#> Connectivity: 80 % 
#> --- 
#> Call:
#> select.estimate(x = fit_analytic, ci_width = 0.95)
#> --- 
#> Selected:
#>  
#> Partial correlations 
#>  
#>       1     2     3    4    5
#> 1  0.00 -0.24 -0.11 0.00 0.00
#> 2 -0.24  0.00  0.29 0.16 0.16
#> 3 -0.11  0.29  0.00 0.18 0.36
#> 4  0.00  0.16  0.18 0.00 0.12
#> 5  0.00  0.16  0.36 0.12 0.00
#> --- 
#>  
#> Adjacency 
#>  
#>   1 2 3 4 5
#> 1 0 1 1 0 0
#> 2 1 0 1 1 1
#> 3 1 1 0 1 1
#> 4 0 1 1 0 1
#> 5 0 1 1 1 0
#> ---
```

The analytic solution works directly with the precision matrix, and thus, there is not an option to summarize the posterior distributions. This is because the non-standardized elements are in the opposite direction (±) of the partial correlations, which in our experience, can lead to confusion. To summarize the partial correlations change `analytic = T` to `analytic = F`:

``` r
# sample from posterior
fit_sampling <- estimate(Y, analytic = F)

# select the graph
E <- select(fit_sampling, ci_width = 0.95)

# summarize partial correlations
summary(E, summarize = T, digits = 2)

#> select.estimate(x = fit_sampling, ci_width = 0.95)
#> --- 
#> Estimates: 
#>  
#>  egde post_mean post_sd   2.5%  97.5%

#>  1--3   -0.1076   0.019 -0.145 -0.071
#>  2--3    0.2859   0.017  0.251  0.319
#>  1--4   -0.0078   0.019 -0.045  0.030
#>  2--4    0.1647   0.019  0.127  0.202
#>  3--4    0.1779   0.019  0.140  0.215
#>  1--5   -0.0088   0.019 -0.047  0.029
#>  2--5    0.1567   0.018  0.120  0.193
#>  3--5    0.3588   0.017  0.325  0.392
#>  4--5    0.1212   0.019  0.084  0.159
#> ---
```

Note that `edge` corresponds to that particular entry in the partial correlation matrix--i.e., `1--2` is the relation between the first and second variables, respectively.

**BGGM** provides several options for plotting, with each implemented as a S3 generic. For example, the partial correlations can be plotted with:

``` r
# p = 10
Y <- BGGM::bfi[,1:10]

# sampling required
fit_sampling <- estimate(Y, analytic = F)

# plot
plot_1A <- plot(fit_sampling, 
                ci_width = 0.95, 
                width = 0.1,  
                size = 2) +
            coord_cartesian() +
            theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
  
plot_1A
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This example nicely demonstrates how the `plot` objects can be further customized with **ggplot2**. There are two options for visualizing the selected graph. The heatmap plot is generated with:

``` r
# select the graph
E <- select(fit_sampling, ci_width = 0.95)

# heatmap plot
plot_1B <- plot(E, 
                type = "heatmap", 
                lower_tri = TRUE) +
           ggtitle("Heatmap Plot") + 
           theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 15))
plot_1B
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Here `lower_tri = TRUE` controls which partial correlations are plotted. In this case, only the lower triangular elements are included in the plot. This can be changed with `lower_tri = FALSE`.

On the other hand, a “network” plot can be obtained with:

``` r
# network plot
plot_1C <- plot(E, type = "network",
                layout ='circle',
                node_outer = 8,
                node_inner = 7,
                node_text_size = 4) +
           ggtitle("Network Plot") +
           theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 15))
plot_1C
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

A key feature of **BGGM** is extending inference beyond identifying non-zero partial correlations. The region of practical equivalence can be used for this purpose, as it allows for determining which relations are practically zero. In this case, we follow Cohen’s guidelines, wherein 0.1 is considered a small effect.This is implemented with:

``` r
# p = 10
Y <- BGGM::bfi[,1:10]

# sample from posterior
fit_sample <- estimate(Y, samples = 5000, analytic = F)

# select the graph
E <- select(fit_sample, rope = 0.1, prob = 0.95)
#> ci_width is ignored

# summary for first 10 rows
head(E, nrow = 10, summarize = T, digits = 2)
#> BGGM: Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Models 
#> --- 
#> Type: Selected Graph (Sampling) 
#> Probability: 0.95 
#> Region of Practical Equivalence:[-0.1, 0.1]
#> Connectivity: 31.1 % 
#> --- 
#> Call:
#> select.estimate(x = fit_sample, rope = 0.1, prob = 0.95)
#> --- 
#> pr_out: post prob outside of rope 
#> pr_in: post prob inside of rope 
#> --- 
#> Estimates: 
#>  
#>  egde post_mean post_sd pr_out  pr_in
#>  1--2    -0.244   0.019   1.00 0.0000
#>  1--3    -0.106   0.019   0.62 0.3830
#>  2--3     0.287   0.018   1.00 0.0000
#>  1--4    -0.015   0.019   0.00 1.0000
#>  2--4     0.161   0.019   1.00 0.0002
#>  3--4     0.160   0.019   1.00 0.0012
#>  1--5    -0.016   0.020   0.00 1.0000
#>  2--5     0.145   0.019   0.99 0.0082
#>  3--5     0.354   0.017   1.00 0.0000
#>  4--5     0.115   0.019   0.78 0.2192
#> ---
```

The argument `prob = 0.95` requires that 95 % of the posterior density be in or out of the rope to be considered practically equivalent or different from zero. With this decision rule, as seen with `head(.)`, edges `1--4` and `1--5` are practically equivalent to zero. This inference is made possible with **BGGM**.

In this case, `plot(.)` returns two objects: (1) the selected edges; (2) those for which there is support for the null values. These plots are displayed. This is implemented with:

``` r
# network plot
plts <- plot(E, type = "network",
             layout ='circle',
             node_outer = 10,
             node_inner = 9,
             node_text_size = 6)

# practically non-zero
plot_1D <- plts$plot_nonzero +
             ggtitle("Practically Non-zero") +
             theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 15))

plot_1D
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

``` r
# practically zero
plot_1E <- plts$plot_zero +
              ggtitle("Practically Zero") +
              theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 15))

plot_1E
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We emphasize that GGMs are often thought to capture conditionally *independent* relations--i.e., evidence for the null hypothesis of no effect, conditional on the other variables in the model. However, the dominant approach assesses conditional *dependence* (*ρ*<sub>*i**j*</sub> ≠ 0), and then sets relations to zero otherwise. **BGGM** can explicitly answer the question of conditional independence.

Edge Differences
----------------

Differences between partial correlations are often tested in GGMs; for example, with a classical (i.e., frequentist) approach that is implemented in **bootnet**. One contribution of **BGGM** is providing Bayesian analogs for commonly used methods, as well as extensions to those methods. In this case, we can use posterior probabilities to determine which edges are practically equivalent. This is implemented with:

``` r
# edge differences
edge_difference <- edge_compare(fit_sample, contrast = "all", ci_width = 0.95, rope = 0.1)

# summary for first 5 contrasts
head(edge_difference, nrow = 5)
#> BGGM: Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Models 
#> --- 
#> Type: Edge comparison(s) 
#> Credible Interval: 95 % 
#> Region of Practical Equivalence:[-0.1, 0.1]
#> --- 
#> Call:
#> edge_compare.estimate(x = fit_sample, contrast = "all", ci_width = 0.95, 
#>     rope = 0.1)
#> --- 
#> Estimates: 
#>  
#>   contrast post_mean post_sd pr_out pr_in
#>  1--2-1--3    -0.138   0.031  0.883 0.117
#>  1--2-2--3    -0.530   0.024  1.000 0.000
#>  1--2-1--4    -0.229   0.029  1.000 0.000
#>  1--2-2--4    -0.405   0.026  1.000 0.000
#>  1--2-3--4    -0.404   0.027  1.000 0.000
#> ---
```

This output includes the posterior mean and standard deviation for each difference. Further, `pr_out` is the proportion of samples included between (±) 0.1. This can be interpreted as the posterior probability of practical equivalence, which has been defined with the argument `rope = 0.1`. Further, this powerful function can be used to assess specific contrasts. This can be accomplished, for example, with 5--1 - 6--10. Note that care must be taken when specifying the contrasts, as an error will arise if they are not in the proper format.

The object `edge_difference` can the be plotted with:

``` r
# plot contrasts
plot_diff <- plot(edge_difference, prob = .99)

# practically different
plot_2A <- plot_diff$plt_nonzero +
           ggtitle("Practically Different") +
           theme(axis.text.y = element_blank())
plot_2A
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

``` r
# practically equivalent
plot_2B <- plot_diff$plt_zero +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-0.4, 0.4)) +
  ggtitle("Practically Equivalent") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank())

plot_2B
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This shows the central idea behind the region of practical equivalence, which is highlighted in grey. Ideally only a few contrasts would be examined in light of a guiding theory.

Prediction
----------

The following is based on the correspondence between the elements of the precision matrix and multiple regression. In the context of GGMs, using regression to select edges is referred to as “neighborhood” selection. On the other hand, the method described in Williams (2018) works directly with either the posterior distribution for the precision matrix or the maximum a posteriori estimates. These are then converted to the corresponding regression coefficients and residual variances. It follows that **BGGM** can also be used for the purpose of multiple regression–i.e.,

``` r
# p = 10
Y <- BGGM::bfi[,1:10]

# sample posterior
fit <- estimate(Y, samples = 5000)

# precision to regression
coefficients(fit, node = 1, ci_width = 0.95)
#> BGGM: Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Models 
#> --- 
#> Type: Inverse to Regression 
#> --- 
#> Call: 
#> BGGM:::beta_summary(x = fit, node = node, ci_width = ci_width, 
#>     samples = samples)
#> --- 
#> Estimates: 
#>  
#>  node post_mean post_sd   2.5%  97.5%
#>     2    -0.278   0.022 -0.319 -0.233
#>     3    -0.124   0.022 -0.168 -0.083
#>     4    -0.015   0.020 -0.053  0.026
#>     5    -0.018   0.021 -0.060  0.023
#>     6     0.057   0.021  0.016  0.096
#>     7     0.080   0.021  0.040  0.121
#>     8     0.043   0.020  0.004  0.083
#>     9     0.142   0.022  0.101  0.185
#>    10    -0.030   0.021 -0.071  0.011
#> ---
```

Here `node = 1` indicates which node is summarized. This correspondence allows for computing measures of prediction error (or accuracy), including Bayesian *R*<sup>2</sup> and Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation, each of which has a measure of uncertainty. Furthermore, when a computationally convenient option is desirable, **BGGM** includes an analytic expression for prediction error. This is also known as the predicted residual sums of squares (PRESS).

### Bayesian *R*<sup>2</sup>

In-sample Bayesian *R*<sup>2</sup> is implemented with:

``` r
# training data
Y_train <- BGGM::bfi[1:100,1:10]

# fit to training data
fit_train <- estimate(Y_train, samples = 5000)

# compute Bayes R2
train_R2 <- predict(fit_train,
                    ci_width = 0.90,
                    samples = 1000,
                    measure = "R2")

# summary for first 2 rows
head(train_R2, nrow = 2)
#> BGGM: Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Models 
#> --- 
#> Type: In-sample predictive accuracy 
#> Measure: Variance Explained (R2) 
#> --- 
#> Call:
#> predict.estimate(fit = fit_train, ci_width = 0.9, samples = 1000, 
#>     measure = "R2")
#> --- 
#> Estimates: 
#> 
#>  node post_mean    post_sd       2.5%     97.5%
#>     1 0.1687363 0.06684558 0.04710252 0.3063529
#>     2 0.2851956 0.07065163 0.14438180 0.4094888
#> ---
```

Here `ci_width = 0.90` indicates the decision rule for setting coefficients to zero, and by default, 95 % intervals are used to in the summary output. Similarly, out-of-sample Bayesian *R*<sup>2</sup> is computed with:

``` r
# test data
Y_test <-  BGGM::bfi[101:2000,1:10]

# predict test data
test_R2 <- predict(fit_train, ci_width = 0.90,
                   test_data = Y_test,
                   samples = 1000, measure = "R2")
```

The work flow is completed by visualizing Bayesian *R*<sup>2</sup> for each node–i.e.,

``` r
# prior training and test error in the same plot
plt_3A <- plot(x1 = train_R2, x2 =  test_R2, order = "test")

plt_3A
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Here the nodes have been ordered by which has the best out-of-sample performance. It is also possible to predict each in seperate plot by leaving `x2` empty. The `predict` object can be used to assess differences in predictive accuracy with compare(.). **BGGM** also includes mean squared error (`measure = "mse"`).

### Leave-one-out cross-validation

Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation is implemented with:

``` r
# p = 10
Y <- BGGM::bfi[1:1000,1:10]

# sample posterior
fit_sample <- estimate(Y, samples = 5000)

# Bayesian LOO
bayes_loo <- loocv(fit_sample)

# nodewise loo summary
summary(bayes_loo)
#> BGGM: Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Models 
#> --- 
#> Type: Leave-One-Out Prediction Error (Bayesian) 
#> --- 
#> Call:
#> loocv.default(x = fit_sample)
#> --- 
#> Estimates: 
#> 
#>   node      loo   loo_se
#>     1 2573.748 48.59837
#>     2 2330.823 63.65590
#>     3 2301.734 64.36837
#>     4 2467.402 51.95522
#>     5 2416.256 55.46030
#>     6 2433.354 58.87974
#>     7 2300.391 50.67988
#>     8 2390.375 51.17164
#>     9 2294.638 51.38352
#>    10 2365.065 39.76016
#> ---
```

The results are plotted with:

``` r
# plot CV error
plt_3B <- plot(bayes_loo, size = 8) +
          theme_classic() +
          ylab("Bayesian Leave-One-Out")

plt_3B
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Similarly, by setting `analytic = T`, leave-one-out prediction error can be computed analytically. This is implemented with:

``` r
# p = 10
Y <- BGGM::bfi[1:1000,1:10]

# analytic solution
fit_analytic <- estimate(Y, analytic = T)

# analytic LOO (PRESS; based on point estimates)
press_loo <- loocv(fit_analytic)

# plot CV error
plt_3C <- plot(press_loo, size = 8) +
          theme_classic() +
